##### TO DO

- "VIEW MODE" with multi handling to cut, paste etc. and create more macros
- "buffer" handling and interaction
- colors => implement fzf --ansi
- history via shell builtins
- more console commands and integration of tools like z
- check all against mksh and zsh
- take OS X into consideration
- rewrite code from liquidprompt
- checkout, how to work with multiplexers and/or embedding of tty emulators
- think about fzf-completion.bash
- by-product: make a better xdg-open via lessopen/lesspipe and with support for all relevant mime types...
