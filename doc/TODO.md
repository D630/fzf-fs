##### TO DO

- "VIEW MODE" with multi handling to cut, paste etc. and create more macros
- "buffer" handling and interaction
- don't use the main command query per default
- colors => waiting for shiny fzf --ansi
- more settings
- history via shell builtins
- more console commands and integration of tools like z
- config file with custom command aliases
- check all against mksh and zsh
- take OS X into consideration
- rewrite code from liquidprompt
- checkout, how to work with multiplexers and/or embedding of tty emulators
- think about fzf-completion.bash
- think about the loadable builtin [read.c](http://sourceforge.net/p/bashdb/code/ci/master/tree/builtin/) from bash debugger
- by-product: make a better xdg-open via lessopen/lesspipe and with support for all relevant mime types...
